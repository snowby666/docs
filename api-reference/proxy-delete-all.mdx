## Overview

Delete all proxy keys associated with your account in a single operation. This is useful for bulk cleanup, security incidents, or account reset scenarios.

<Warning>
**Irreversible Action**: This permanently deletes ALL proxy keys. This action cannot be undone, and all deleted keys will immediately stop working.
</Warning>

## Important Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Immediate Effect">
    All proxy keys stop working immediately. Any applications using these keys will start receiving authentication errors.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Credit Recovery">
    All unused credits from deleted proxy keys are returned to your main account balance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permanent Deletion">
    Deleted keys cannot be recovered. You'll need to recreate any keys you still need.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Confirmation">
    The operation executes immediately without additional confirmation prompts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Before Bulk Deletion

Make sure to:

1. **Audit Current Keys**: Use [List Proxy Keys](/api-reference/proxy-keys) to review what will be deleted
2. **Update Applications**: Remove or replace proxy keys in all applications
3. **Backup Configurations**: Save key settings if you might need to recreate them
4. **Notify Team**: Inform team members who might be using the keys
5. **Check Dependencies**: Verify no critical services depend on the proxy keys

## Example Workflow

```python Python - Safe Bulk Deletion
import httpx

def safe_bulk_delete_proxy_keys(api_key: str) -> dict:
    """Safely delete all proxy keys with confirmation"""
    client = httpx.Client()
    
    # First, list current keys for confirmation
    list_response = client.get(
        "https://api.electronhub.ai/v1/auth/proxy",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    )
    proxy_keys = list_response.json()
    
    if not proxy_keys:
        print("No proxy keys to delete")
        return {"message": "No proxy keys found"}
    
    print(f"Found {len(proxy_keys)} proxy keys:")
    for key in proxy_keys:
        print(f"  - {key['name']} ({key['key']})")
    
    # Confirm deletion
    confirm = input("Delete ALL proxy keys? (type 'DELETE' to confirm): ")
    if confirm != "DELETE":
        print("Deletion cancelled")
        return {"message": "Deletion cancelled"}
    
    # Perform bulk deletion
    delete_response = client.delete(
        "https://api.electronhub.ai/v1/auth/proxy",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    )
    
    result = delete_response.json()
    print(f"Bulk deletion completed: {result['message']}")
    return result

# Execute safe bulk deletion
result = safe_bulk_delete_proxy_keys(api_key)
```

## Alternative Approaches

Consider these alternatives before using bulk deletion:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Individual Deletion">
    Delete specific keys using [Delete Proxy Key](/api-reference/proxy-delete) for more control
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Toggle">
    Temporarily disable all keys instead of deleting them:
    ```python
    # Disable all keys instead of deleting
    for key in proxy_keys:
        toggle_response = client.post(
            f"https://api.electronhub.ai/v1/auth/proxy/toggle/{key['key']}",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
        )
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Selective Cleanup">
    Filter and delete only specific types of keys:
    ```python
    # Delete only expired keys
    import time
    current_time = int(time.time())
    
    for key in proxy_keys:
        if key['expires_at'] != -1 and key['expires_at'] < current_time:
            delete_response = client.delete(
                f"https://api.electronhub.ai/v1/auth/proxy/delete/{key['key']}",
                headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
            )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
