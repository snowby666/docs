## Overview

Generate a new primary API key for your account. This immediately invalidates the current API key and replaces it with a fresh one. This operation is useful for security key rotation or when you suspect your current key has been compromised.

<Warning>
**Immediate Invalidation**: Your current API key stops working immediately after regeneration. All applications using the old key will start receiving authentication errors until updated.
</Warning>

## Response Fields

<ResponseField name="key" type="string">
  The new API key that replaces your current one. Starts with `ek-` followed by a 32-character string.
</ResponseField>

## Important Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Immediate Effect">
    The old API key is invalidated instantly. Any ongoing requests with the old key may fail.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Proxy Keys Unaffected">
    Existing proxy keys continue to work normally. Only the primary API key is regenerated.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account Data Preserved">
    All account data, usage history, credits, and settings remain unchanged.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Rollback">
    You cannot recover the old API key once it's regenerated. The change is permanent.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Post-Regeneration Checklist

After regenerating your API key, make sure to:

1. **Update Applications**: Replace the old key in all applications and services
2. **Update CI/CD**: Update environment variables in deployment pipelines
3. **Notify Team**: Inform team members about the key change
4. **Test Services**: Verify all integrations work with the new key
5. **Update Documentation**: Update any internal docs that reference the old key
6. **Secure Storage**: Store the new key securely using environment variables or key management systems

## Example Implementation

```python Python - Safe Key Regeneration
import httpx
import os
import time

def regenerate_api_key_safely(current_key: str) -> str:
    """Safely regenerate API key with confirmation"""
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will invalidate your current API key!")
    print("Make sure you can update all applications immediately.")
    
    confirm = input("Type 'REGENERATE' to confirm: ")
    if confirm != "REGENERATE":
        print("‚ùå Key regeneration cancelled")
        return current_key
    
    client = httpx.Client()
    try:
        response = client.get(
            "https://api.electronhub.ai/v1/auth/key/regen",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {current_key}"}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        result = response.json()
        new_key = result["key"]
        
        print(f"‚úÖ New API key generated: {new_key}")
        print("üîÑ Old key is now invalid")
        
        # Optionally save to environment file
        save_to_env = input("Save to .env file? (y/n): ")
        if save_to_env.lower() == 'y':
            with open('.env', 'w') as f:
                f.write(f"ELECTRONHUB_API_KEY={new_key}\n")
            print("üíæ Saved to .env file")
        
        return new_key
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error regenerating key: {e}")
        return current_key

# Usage
current_key = os.getenv("ELECTRONHUB_API_KEY")
new_key = regenerate_api_key_safely(current_key)
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Immediate Update">
    Update all applications within minutes of regeneration to minimize service disruption.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Gradual Rollout">
    If you have many integrations, consider using proxy keys for easier management instead of regenerating the main key.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Always store API keys in environment variables, never in code repositories.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Access Logging">
    Monitor API access logs before and after regeneration to ensure no unauthorized usage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alternative: Proxy Keys

Consider using proxy keys instead of regenerating your main API key for:

- **Temporary Access**: Create time-limited keys for specific projects
- **Team Management**: Give each team member their own proxy key
- **Service Isolation**: Use different keys for different applications
- **Easier Rotation**: Rotate individual proxy keys without affecting others

See [Create Proxy Key](/api-reference/proxy-create) for more information.

## Error Codes

<ResponseField name="401" type="error">
  **Unauthorized** - Invalid or missing API key
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="429" type="error">
  **Rate Limited** - Too many regeneration requests (limit: 1 per hour)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="500" type="error">
  **Internal Error** - Failed to generate new key, try again
</ResponseField>
