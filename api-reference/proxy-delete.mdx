## Overview

Permanently delete a specific proxy key. This action cannot be undone, and the proxy key will immediately stop working for all API requests.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="proxy_key" type="string" required>
  The proxy key ID to delete (starts with `ek-proxy-`)
</ParamField>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
**Immediate Effect**: The proxy key stops working immediately after deletion. Any applications using this key will start receiving authentication errors.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Irreversible**: Deletion is permanent. You cannot recover a deleted proxy key - you'll need to create a new one.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Credit Recovery**: Any unused credits allocated to the proxy key are returned to your main account balance.
</Info>

## Before Deleting

Make sure to:

1. **Update Applications**: Remove or replace the proxy key in any applications that use it
2. **Check Dependencies**: Verify no critical services depend on this specific key
3. **Document Changes**: Record the deletion for audit purposes
4. **Backup Configuration**: Save the key's settings if you might need to recreate it later

## Bulk Operations

To delete all proxy keys at once, use the [Delete All Proxy Keys](/api-reference/proxy-delete-all) endpoint instead.

## Error Codes

<ResponseField name="401" type="error">
  **Unauthorized** - Invalid or missing API key
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="403" type="error">
  **Forbidden** - You don't have permission to delete this proxy key
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="404" type="error">
  **Not Found** - Proxy key doesn't exist or was already deleted
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="429" type="error">

</ResponseField>

## Alternative: Toggle Status

If you want to temporarily disable a proxy key instead of permanently deleting it, consider using the [Toggle Proxy Key Status](/api-reference/proxy-toggle) endpoint instead. This allows you to disable and re-enable keys as needed.
