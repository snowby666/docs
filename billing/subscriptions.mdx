## <Icon icon="calendar" /> Annual vs Monthly Billing

<Card title="Save 20% with Annual Billing" icon="percent" color="#10B981">
  **Annual subscriptions save you 20%** compared to monthly billing!
  
  **Example:**
  - Monthly Pro tier: `$X`/month
  - Annual Pro tier: `$X` × 12 × 0.8 = Save 20% per year
</Card>

<Callout type="tip">
  Annual subscriptions are perfect for users who:
  - Plan to use the service long-term
  - Want to maximize value
  - Prefer fewer payment transactions
</Callout>

## <Icon icon="infinity" /> Enterprise Tier (Custom Plan)

The **Enterprise tier (Tier 4)** is a custom plan that scales with your Patreon payment amount:

<Card title="Base Benefits" icon="package" color="#F59E0B">
  - Base daily credits: **69 credits**
  - Base monthly cost: `$79.20` (old plan) or `$199.20` (new plan, 80% of `$249`)
  - <Icon icon="bot" /> 200 max bots
  - <Icon icon="sparkles" /> 500 studio credits
</Card>

<Card title="Custom Scaling" icon="trending-up" color="#8B5CF6">
  If you pay more than the base cost on Patreon, your daily credits scale automatically:
  
  **Extra credits formula**: For every dollar above the base cost, you get **0.5 additional credits**
  
  **Example**: If you pay `$300`/month instead of `$249`:
  - Extra paid: `$300` - `$249` = `$51`
  - Extra credits: `$51` × 0.5 = 25.5 credits
  - **Total daily credits**: 69 + 25.5 = **94.5 credits/day**
</Card>

<Callout type="info">
  **How it works:**
  - Your Patreon payment amount is automatically detected
  - Daily credits are calculated based on your actual payment
  - Credits update automatically when your payment changes
  - Works for both monthly and yearly subscriptions (yearly payments are divided by 12 for monthly calculation)
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  This allows Enterprise users to customize their plan based on their needs and budget.
