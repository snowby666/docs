# Subscriptions

Subscriptions provide daily credits that automatically reset every day, along with access to premium features and models.

## Subscription Tiers

Electron Hub offers several subscription tiers through Patreon:

| Tier | Name | Daily Credits | Max Bots | Studio Credits |
|------|------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| 0 | Free | 0.25 | 5 | 5 |
| 1 | Starter | 2 | 20 | 20 |
| 5 | Plus | 5 | 30 | 50 |
| 6 | Core | 10 | 50 | 75 |
| 2 | Pro | 15 | 100 | 150 |
| 3 | Business | 30 | 150 | 300 |
| 4 | Enterprise | 69+ (custom) | 200 | 500 |

**Benefits of Higher Tiers:**
- More daily credits
- Access to premium/ultimate models
- Higher rate limits
- More bot creation slots
- More studio credits (for AI bot creation)

## Annual vs Monthly Billing

**Annual subscriptions save you 20%** compared to monthly billing!

**Example:**
- Monthly Pro tier: `$X`/month
- Annual Pro tier: `$X` × 12 × 0.8 = Save 20% per year

Annual subscriptions are perfect for users who:
- Plan to use the service long-term
- Want to maximize value
- Prefer fewer payment transactions

## Enterprise Tier (Custom Plan)

The **Enterprise tier (Tier 4)** is a custom plan that scales with your Patreon payment amount:

**Base Benefits:**
- Base daily credits: **69 credits**
- Base monthly cost: `$79.20` (old plan) or `$199.20` (new plan, 80% of `$249`)
- 200 max bots
- 500 studio credits

**Custom Scaling:**
If you pay more than the base cost on Patreon, your daily credits scale automatically:
- **Extra credits formula**: For every dollar above the base cost, you get **0.5 additional credits**
- **Example**: If you pay `$300`/month instead of `$249`:
  - Extra paid: `$300` - `$249` = `$51`
  - Extra credits: `$51` × 0.5 = 25.5 credits
  - **Total daily credits**: 69 + 25.5 = **94.5 credits/day**

**How it works:**
- Your Patreon payment amount is automatically detected
- Daily credits are calculated based on your actual payment
- Credits update automatically when your payment changes
- Works for both monthly and yearly subscriptions (yearly payments are divided by 12 for monthly calculation)

This allows Enterprise users to customize their plan based on their needs and budget.

## How to Subscribe

Subscriptions are managed through **Patreon**. To subscribe:

1. **First, purchase your subscription on Patreon** - Visit the Electron Hub Patreon page and select your desired tier
2. Go to the [Electron Hub Dashboard](https://playground.electronhub.ai/console) → **Billing** section
3. Link your Patreon account to your Electron Hub account
4. Your subscription benefits will be applied automatically

**Important**: You must purchase the subscription on Patreon first before linking your account. If you link your account without an active Patreon subscription, you won't receive any benefits.

## Subscription Renewal

Subscriptions renew based on your Patreon subscription cycle (usually monthly or annually). Your subscription expiry date is shown in your dashboard.

## What Happens When Subscription Expires?

If your subscription expires:
- You'll be downgraded to the Free tier
- You'll receive 0.25 daily credits
- You'll lose access to premium/ultimate models
- Your permanent credits remain (they never expire)
- Your flex credits remain (if you have any)

## Daily Credits Reset

Daily credits reset every day at **21:00 UTC** (9:00 PM UTC). Unused daily credits do **not** carry over to the next day - this is why [Flex Credits](/billing/credits#flex-credits) are useful for saving unused credits.
