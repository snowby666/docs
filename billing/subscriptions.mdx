<Card title="Benefits of Higher Tiers" icon="arrow-up" color="#8B5CF6">
  - More daily credits
  - Access to premium/ultimate models
  - Higher rate limits
  - More bot creation slots
  - More studio credits (for AI bot creation)
</Card>

## Annual vs Monthly Billing

<Card title="Save 20% with Annual Billing" icon="percent" color="#10B981">
  **Annual subscriptions save you 20%** compared to monthly billing!
  
  **Example:**
  - Monthly Pro tier: `$X`/month
  - Annual Pro tier: `$X` × 12 × 0.8 = Save 20% per year
</Card>

<Tip>
  Annual subscriptions are perfect for users who:
  - Plan to use the service long-term
  - Want to maximize value
  - Prefer fewer payment transactions
</Tip>

## Enterprise Tier (Custom Plan)

The **Enterprise tier (Tier 4)** is a custom plan that scales with your Patreon payment amount:

<Card title="Base Benefits" icon="gift" color="#F59E0B">
  - Base daily credits: **69 credits**
  - Base monthly cost: `$79.20` (old plan) or `$199.20` (new plan, 80% of `$249`)
  - 200 max bots
  - 500 studio credits
</Card>

<Card title="Custom Scaling" icon="arrow-up" color="#8B5CF6">
  If you pay more than the base cost on Patreon, your daily credits scale automatically:
  
  **Extra credits formula**: For every dollar above the base cost, you get **0.5 additional credits**
  
  **Example**: If you pay `$300`/month instead of `$249`:
  - Extra paid: `$300` - `$249` = `$51`
  - Extra credits: `$51` × 0.5 = 25.5 credits
  - **Total daily credits**: 69 + 25.5 = **94.5 credits/day**
</Card>

<Info>
  **How it works:**
  - Your Patreon payment amount is automatically detected
  - Daily credits are calculated based on your actual payment
  - Credits update automatically when your payment changes
  - Works for both monthly and yearly subscriptions (yearly payments are divided by 12 for monthly calculation)
</Info>

<Tip>
  This allows Enterprise users to customize their plan based on their needs and budget.

## How to Subscribe

Subscriptions are managed through **Patreon**. To subscribe:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase on Patreon">
    Visit the Electron Hub Patreon page and select your desired tier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Dashboard">
    Go to the [Electron Hub Dashboard](https://playground.electronhub.ai/console) → **Billing** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Accounts">
    Link your Patreon account to your Electron Hub account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate Benefits">
    Your subscription benefits will be applied automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  <strong>Important:</strong> You must purchase the subscription on Patreon first before linking your account. If you link your account without an active Patreon subscription, you won't receive any benefits.
</Warning>

## Subscription Renewal

<Card title="Automatic Renewal" icon="repeat" color="#8B5CF6">
  Subscriptions renew based on your Patreon subscription cycle (usually monthly or annually). Your subscription expiry date is shown in your dashboard.
</Card>

## What Happens When Subscription Expires?

<Warning>
  If your subscription expires:
  - You'll be downgraded to the Free tier
  - You'll receive 0.25 daily credits
  - You'll lose access to premium/ultimate models
  - Your permanent credits remain (they never expire)
  - Your flex credits remain (if you have any)
</Warning>

## Daily Credits Reset

<Info>
  Daily credits reset every day at **21:00 UTC** (9:00 PM UTC). Unused daily credits do <strong>not</strong> carry over to the next day - this is why [Flex Credits](/billing/credits#flex-credits) are useful for saving unused credits.
