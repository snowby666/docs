# Billing Troubleshooting

Common billing issues and how to resolve them.

## I ran out of credits. What can I do?

1. **Wait for daily reset** (21:00 UTC) to get your daily credits
2. **Enable flex credits** if you have any saved
3. **Enable permanent credits** if you have purchased credits
4. **Purchase more permanent credits** through PayPal
5. **Upgrade your subscription** for more daily credits

## My credits didn't reset at 21:00 UTC

Credits reset automatically at 21:00 UTC. If you don't see your credits:
1. Refresh your dashboard
2. Check that it's actually past 21:00 UTC
3. Contact support if the issue persists

## I purchased credits but they're not showing up

1. Check your PayPal payment status
2. Refresh your dashboard
3. Check your permanent credits balance (separate from regular balance)
4. Make sure permanent credits are enabled in your settings
5. Contact support with your order ID if still not showing

## Why can't I use a premium or ultimate model?

**Premium models** require a **Starter plan or higher** subscription. 

**Ultimate models** require a **Pro tier or higher** subscription.

Check your subscription tier in the dashboard. If you're on a lower tier, you'll need to upgrade through Patreon to access these models.

## How do I enable/disable flex credits or permanent credits?

You can manage these settings in the [Electron Hub Dashboard](https://playground.electronhub.ai/console):
- Navigate to account settings
- Toggle flex credits on/off
- Toggle permanent credits on/off
- Set permanent credits monthly limits

## Why are free models sometimes unavailable?

Free models are hosted by Electron Hub and may experience downtime during peak usage to ensure fair resource distribution. For better reliability:
- Use freemium models (they deduct credits but have better uptime)
- Subscribe to access premium models (routed to multiple providers for maximum uptime)

## Refund Requests

**Permanent Credits Purchases**: Refunds are available within 30 days of purchase if you haven't used the credits. Once credits have been used, refunds are not available except in cases of technical errors or service issues.

**Subscription Refunds**: Subscriptions are managed through Patreon. Refund requests for subscriptions should be made through Patreon's refund system.

**Failed Requests**: Credits are **not charged** for failed requests (only successful and cancelled requests are charged). If you believe you were incorrectly charged for a failed request, contact support with your request ID.

**Technical Issues**: If you experience technical issues that prevent you from using the service, contact support for assistance. Refunds may be provided on a case-by-case basis.

To request a refund, contact support through the dashboard or email with:
- Your order ID or transaction ID
- Reason for refund request
- Date of purchase

For complete refund terms, please review our [Terms of Service](https://tos.electronhub.ai).
