## What are Permanent Credits?

<Card icon="wallet" color="#10B981">
  **Permanent Credits** are credits you purchase with real money. Unlike daily credits, these credits:
  - **Never expire** - they stay in your account forever
  - Can be purchased through **PayPal** or **Cryptocurrency**
  - Can be used alongside daily credits
  - Have volume discounts (the more you spend, the more bonus credits you get)
