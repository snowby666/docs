Pay-as-You-Go allows you to purchase permanent credits that never expire. This gives you maximum flexibility without any recurring commitment.


## What are Permanent Credits?

<Card icon="wallet" color="#10B981">
  **Permanent Credits** are credits you purchase with real money. Unlike daily credits, these credits:
  - **Never expire** - they stay in your account forever
  - Can be purchased through PayPal
  - Can be used alongside daily credits
  - Have volume discounts (the more you spend, the more bonus credits you get)
