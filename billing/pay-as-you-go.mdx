# Pay-as-You-Go (Permanent Credits)

Pay-as-You-Go allows you to purchase permanent credits that never expire. This gives you maximum flexibility without any recurring commitment.

## What are Permanent Credits?

**Permanent Credits** are credits you purchase with real money. Unlike daily credits, these credits:
- **Never expire** - they stay in your account forever
- Can be purchased through PayPal
- Can be used alongside daily credits
- Have volume discounts (the more you spend, the more bonus credits you get)

## Pricing

**Base Rate:**
- **`$1` USD = 3 credits**

**Volume Discounts:**
- Every `$500` spent gives you a 10% bonus
- Maximum discount: 30% bonus (reached at `$1,500+` total spending)

**Example:**
- First purchase: `$100` = 300 credits (no bonus yet)
- After `$500` total: `$100` purchase = 330 credits (10% bonus)
- After `$1,500` total: `$100` purchase = 390 credits (30% bonus, maximum)

## How to Purchase

1. Go to the [Electron Hub Dashboard](https://playground.electronhub.ai/console)
2. Navigate to the credits/payment section
3. Select the amount you want to purchase
4. Complete the payment through PayPal
5. Credits are added to your account immediately after payment

## Payment Limits

To prevent abuse, there are limits on purchases:
- **Daily limit**: 20 orders per day
- **Monthly limit**: `$5,000` USD per month
- These limits reset automatically

## Monthly Spending Limits

You can set a **monthly spending limit** for permanent credits to control costs:
- **0 = Unlimited** (no limit)
- **Any positive number** = Maximum amount you can spend per month
- **Maximum limit**: `$100,000` USD per month
- Limits reset on the 1st of each month

**Use cases:**
- Budget control for teams
- Preventing accidental overspending
- Managing costs for production applications

## Rate Limit Scaling

Your rate limits scale based on your **total purchased credits** (permanent credits spending). See [Rate Limit Scaling](/billing/advanced#rate-limit-scaling) for details.

## Low Balance Alerts

You can enable **low balance alerts** for permanent credits:
- Set a threshold (e.g., 10 credits)
- Receive email alerts when your permanent credits balance drops below the threshold
- Alerts are sent at most once every 24 hours (to prevent spam)

## Refund Policy

**Permanent Credits Purchases**: Refunds are available within 30 days of purchase if you haven't used the credits. Once credits have been used, refunds are not available except in cases of technical errors or service issues.

For complete refund terms, please review our [Terms of Service](https://tos.electronhub.ai).
