## No-Log Policy for Prompts

<Info>
  **We do not log your prompt content.** Your prompts and AI responses are not stored in our logs. We only log:
  - Request metadata (model used, tokens, credits, timestamp, status)
  - Technical information (IP address, API key used, route accessed)
  - Usage statistics (for billing and analytics)
</Info>

<Note>
  **What this means:**
  - Your conversations and prompts remain private
  - We cannot see what you're asking the AI
  - We cannot reconstruct your conversations from our logs
  - Your data privacy is protected
</Note>

## Content Moderation

To comply with our AI provider content policies and legal requirements, we apply moderation to detect and flag requests involving:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="CSAM Detection" icon="ban" color="#EF4444">
    **CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)**: Any content related to child exploitation
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Illegal Activities" icon="ban" color="#F59E0B">
    Content about making drugs, bombs, weapons, or other illegal activities
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Harmful Content" icon="stop-circle" color="#EF4444">
    Content that could cause real-world harm
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Info>
  **How it works:**
  - Requests are automatically scanned before being sent to AI providers
  - Flagged requests are blocked and not processed
  - No credits are charged for blocked requests
  - This helps us maintain compliance with provider policies and legal requirements
</Info>

<Note>
  **Your privacy is still protected:**
  - Moderation checks are automated and do not involve human review of your content
  - We do not store the content of blocked requests
  - This is a necessary measure to ensure service availability and legal compliance
</Note>
