## No-Log Policy for Prompts

**We do not log your prompt content.** Your prompts and AI responses are not stored in our logs. We only log:
- Request metadata (model used, tokens, credits, timestamp, status)
- Technical information (IP address, API key used, route accessed)
- Usage statistics (for billing and analytics)

**What this means:**
- Your conversations and prompts remain private
- We cannot see what you're asking the AI
- We cannot reconstruct your conversations from our logs
- Your data privacy is protected

## Content Moderation

To comply with our AI provider content policies and legal requirements, we apply moderation to detect and flag requests involving:
- **CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)**: Any content related to child exploitation
- **Illegal Activities**: Content about making drugs, bombs, weapons, or other illegal activities
- **Harmful Content**: Content that could cause real-world harm

**How it works:**
- Requests are automatically scanned before being sent to AI providers
- Flagged requests are blocked and not processed
- No credits are charged for blocked requests
- This helps us maintain compliance with provider policies and legal requirements

**Your privacy is still protected:**
- Moderation checks are automated and do not involve human review of your content
- We do not store the content of blocked requests
- This is a necessary measure to ensure service availability and legal compliance
