</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">

</Callout>

## <Icon icon="help-circle" /> Why don't free models guarantee 100% uptime?

<Card title="Uptime Explanation" icon="info" color="#F59E0B">
  Free models are hosted by Electron Hub directly, and during peak usage times, we need to ensure fair distribution of resources among all users.
</Card>

<Callout type="tip">
  For guaranteed uptime and better performance, we recommend:
  - Using freemium models (deduct credits but better uptime)
  - Subscribing to a premium tier to access premium models (routed to multiple providers)
</Callout>

<Card title="Check Status" icon="activity" href="https://status.electronhub.ai" color="#10B981">
