# Understanding Credits

Credits are the currency used in Electron Hub to pay for AI model usage. This guide explains all the different types of credits and how they work.

## Types of Credits

### Daily Credits

**Daily Credits** are credits that are automatically added to your account every day at **21:00 UTC** (9:00 PM UTC). The amount you receive depends on your subscription tier:

| Tier | Daily Credits |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 0.25 credits |
| Starter | 2 credits |
| Plus | 5 credits |
| Core | 10 credits |
| Pro | 15 credits |
| Business | 30 credits |
| Enterprise | 69+ credits (scales with custom payment) |

**Important Notes:**
- Daily credits reset at **21:00 UTC** every day
- Unused daily credits do **not** carry over to the next day
- Your balance is automatically set to your daily credits amount at reset time
- Daily credits are separate from permanent credits

### Permanent Credits

**Permanent Credits** are credits you purchase with real money. See [Pay-as-You-Go](/billing/pay-as-you-go) for details.

### Flex Credits

**Flex Credits** (also called "Flex Wallet") are a savings feature that lets you save unused daily credits for later use.

**How it works:**
- You can save up to **20% of your daily credits** per day to your flex wallet
- The total cap is **100% of your daily credits** (e.g., if you get 15 credits/day, your flex wallet can hold up to 15 credits)
- You can only save once every 24 hours
- Flex credits are used automatically when your regular balance runs out (if flex credits are enabled)

**Example:**
- You have a Pro subscription (15 credits/day)
- Daily save limit: 3 credits (20% of 15)
- Maximum flex wallet: 15 credits (100% of daily credits)
- If you save 3 credits every day for 5 days, you'll have 15 credits saved (the maximum)

**When to use Flex Credits:**
- Enable flex credits if you want to build up a buffer for heavy usage days
- Useful if you don't use all your daily credits every day
- Helps prevent losing unused credits at daily reset

### Neutrinos

**Neutrinos** are special free usage requests for **free models** (models that end with `:free` suffix). 

**Key Points:**
- All users get **10 Neutrinos per day** (resets at 21:00 UTC)
- Neutrinos are used instead of credits for free models
- You can earn more Neutrinos by watching ads (if available)
- **Important**: Neutrinos are charged for **all requests** (failed, cancelled, and successful) - unlike regular credits which are only charged for successful/cancelled requests

## How Credits are Deducted

Credits are deducted in this priority order:
1. **Permanent credits** (if enabled and within monthly limit)
2. **Regular balance** (daily credits)
3. **Flex credits** (if enabled)

**Important Charging Rules:**
- **Regular Credits**: Only charged for **successful** and **cancelled** requests. **Failed requests are NOT charged.**
- **Neutrinos**: Charged for **all requests** (failed, cancelled, and successful) - this is different from regular credits.

**Example:**
- You have 5 permanent credits, 10 regular credits, and 3 flex credits
- You make a request costing 15 credits
- System uses: 5 permanent + 10 regular + 3 flex = 18 credits total (you have enough!)

**Failed Request Example:**
- You make a request that fails (e.g., model unavailable, timeout)
- **Regular credits**: NOT charged (you keep your credits)
- **Neutrinos**: Still charged (if using a `:free` model)

## Credit Reset Times

- **Daily credits**: Reset every day at **21:00 UTC** (9:00 PM UTC)
- **Neutrinos**: Reset every day at **21:00 UTC**
- **Permanent credits**: Never reset (they're permanent!)
- **Flex credits**: Never reset (but you can only save once per 24 hours)
- **Monthly spending limits**: Reset on the 1st of each month (for permanent credits monthly limits)

## Checking Your Balance

You can check your balance:
- In the [Electron Hub Dashboard](https://playground.electronhub.ai/console)
- Through the API by checking your user information
- Balance includes: regular credits, flex credits (if enabled), and permanent credits (if enabled)

## Managing Credit Settings

You can manage these settings in the [Electron Hub Dashboard](https://playground.electronhub.ai/console):

## Credit Transfers
