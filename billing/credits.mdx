Credits are the currency used in Electron Hub to pay for AI model usage. This guide explains all the different types of credits and how they work.


## Types of Credits

<Accordion title="Daily Credits" icon="repeat">
  **Daily Credits** are credits that are automatically added to your account every day at **21:00 UTC** (9:00 PM UTC). The amount you receive depends on your subscription tier:

  | Tier | Daily Credits |
  |------|---------------|
  | Free | 0.25 credits |
  | Starter | 2 credits |
  | Plus | 5 credits |
  | Core | 10 credits |
  | Pro | 15 credits |
  | Business | 30 credits |
  | Enterprise | 69+ credits (scales with custom payment) |

  <Warning>
    <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
    - Daily credits reset at **21:00 UTC** every day
    - Unused daily credits do <strong>not</strong> carry over to the next day
    - Your balance is automatically set to your daily credits amount at reset time
    - Daily credits are separate from permanent credits
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permanent Credits" icon="wallet">
  **Permanent Credits** are credits you purchase with real money. 
  
  <Card title="Key Features" icon="infinity" color="#10B981">
    - Never expire
    - Volume discounts available
    - Can be used alongside daily credits
  </Card>
  
  See [Pay-as-You-Go](/billing/pay-as-you-go) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Flex Credits" icon="wallet">
  **Flex Credits** (also called "Flex Wallet") are a savings feature that lets you save unused daily credits for later use.

  <Info>
    **How it works:**
    - You can save up to **20% of your daily credits** per day to your flex wallet
    - The total cap is **100% of your daily credits** (e.g., if you get 15 credits/day, your flex wallet can hold up to 15 credits)
    - You can only save once every 24 hours
    - Flex credits are used automatically when your regular balance runs out (if flex credits are enabled)
  </Info>

  <Card title="Example" icon="calculator" color="#F59E0B">
    - You have a Pro subscription (15 credits/day)
    - Daily save limit: 3 credits (20% of 15)
    - Maximum flex wallet: 15 credits (100% of daily credits)
    - If you save 3 credits every day for 5 days, you'll have 15 credits saved (the maximum)
  </Card>

  <Tip>
    <strong>When to use Flex Credits:</strong>
    - Enable flex credits if you want to build up a buffer for heavy usage days
    - Useful if you don't use all your daily credits every day
    - Helps prevent losing unused credits at daily reset
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Neutrinos" icon="zap">
  **Neutrinos** are special free usage requests for **free models** (models that end with `:free` suffix). 

  <Info>
    **Key Points:**
    - All users get **10 Neutrinos per day** (resets at 21:00 UTC)
    - Neutrinos are used instead of credits for free models
    - You can earn more Neutrinos by watching ads (if available)
  </Info>

  <Warning>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Neutrinos are charged for <strong>all requests</strong> (failed, cancelled, and successful) - unlike regular credits which are only charged for successful/cancelled requests.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

## How Credits are Deducted

<Card title="Deduction Priority" icon="list" color="#8B5CF6">
  Credits are deducted in this priority order:
  1. **Permanent credits** (if enabled and within monthly limit)
  2. **Regular balance** (daily credits)
  3. **Flex credits** (if enabled)
</Card>

<Warning>
  **Charging Rules:**
  
  **Regular Credits:** Only charged for **successful** and **cancelled** requests. **Failed requests are NOT charged.**
  
  **Neutrinos:** Charged for **all requests** (failed, cancelled, and successful) - this is different from regular credits.
</Warning>

<Card title="Example: Successful Request" icon="check-circle" color="#10B981">
  - You have 5 permanent credits, 10 regular credits, and 3 flex credits
  - You make a request costing 15 credits
  - System uses: 5 permanent + 10 regular + 3 flex = 18 credits total (you have enough!)
</Card>

<Card title="Example: Failed Request" icon="x" color="#F59E0B">
  - You make a request that fails (e.g., model unavailable, timeout)
  - **Regular credits**: NOT charged (you keep your credits)
  - **Neutrinos**: Still charged (if using a `:free` model)
</Card>
