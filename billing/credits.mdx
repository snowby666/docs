# <Icon icon="coins" /> Understanding Credits

Credits are the currency used in Electron Hub to pay for AI model usage. This guide explains all the different types of credits and how they work.

<Callout type="info">

    - Daily credits reset at <Icon icon="clock" /> **21:00 UTC** every day
    - Unused daily credits do <strong>not</strong> carry over to the next day
    - Your balance is automatically set to your daily credits amount at reset time
    - Daily credits are separate from permanent credits
  </Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permanent Credits" icon="wallet">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Flex Credits" icon="piggy-bank">
  **Flex Credits** (also called "Flex Wallet") are a savings feature that lets you save unused daily credits for later use.

  <Card title="How it works" icon="settings" color="#8B5CF6">
    - You can save up to **20% of your daily credits** per day to your flex wallet
    - The total cap is **100% of your daily credits** (e.g., if you get 15 credits/day, your flex wallet can hold up to 15 credits)
    - You can only save once every 24 hours
    - Flex credits are used automatically when your regular balance runs out (if flex credits are enabled)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Example" icon="calculator" color="#F59E0B">
    - You have a Pro subscription (15 credits/day)
    - Daily save limit: 3 credits (20% of 15)
    - Maximum flex wallet: 15 credits (100% of daily credits)
    - If you save 3 credits every day for 5 days, you'll have 15 credits saved (the maximum)
  </Card>

  <Callout type="tip">
    <strong>When to use Flex Credits:</strong>
    - Enable flex credits if you want to build up a buffer for heavy usage days
    - Useful if you don't use all your daily credits every day
    - Helps prevent losing unused credits at daily reset
  </Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Neutrinos" icon="zap">
  **Neutrinos** are special free usage requests for **free models** (models that end with `:free` suffix). 

  <Card title="Key Points" icon="info" color="#10B981">
    - All users get **10 Neutrinos per day** (resets at 21:00 UTC)
    - Neutrinos are used instead of credits for free models
    - You can earn more Neutrinos by watching ads (if available)
