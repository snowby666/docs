Bring images into your ongoing conversations without switching endpoints. In-chat Image Generation lets you request images directly from the `chat/completions` endpoint by selecting a base chat model and an image generation model using a simple suffix syntax.

## How it works

- **Base model**: Your chat model (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- **Image model**: Your image generator (e.g., `flux-pro`)
- **Suffix syntax**: `baseModel@imageModel`

**Example suffix**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514@flux-pro`

When you use a suffixed model with `chat/completions`, the assistant can respond with content that includes generated image(s) inline with its text, keeping the flow immersive for roleplay and storytelling scenarios.

## Example request

```bash
curl https://api.electronhub.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514@flux-pro",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a narrative game master. Embed images when helpful."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a vivid, cinematic portrait of a cyberpunk detective at night in neon rain."}
    ]
  }'
```

Notes:
- The base chat model drives conversation quality and reasoning.
- The image model controls visual style and fidelity.
- The response may include image URLs or Markdown image formatting inside the assistant message content.

## SillyTavern example

Here’s how this looks in SillyTavern when using a suffixed model:

<img src="/images/st-example.png" alt="SillyTavern in‑chat image generation" style="border-radius: 12px;" />

## Tips

- **Be descriptive**: Specify subject, style, lighting, composition, and mood.
- **Stay consistent**: Reuse key style terms across turns for continuity.
- **Guide placement**: Ask the assistant where to insert images within the story.
